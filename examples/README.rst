Examples
========

You've arrived at our quickstart and examples. All of them are delivered as `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`__. This means you need to have Jupyter installed before you start, please check out the `installation documentation <https://jupyter.org/install.html>`__. 

You can run the notebooks as follows 

::

    $ cd examples
    $ jupyter notebook
